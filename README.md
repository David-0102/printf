# Custom printf Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a custom implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The custom `printf` function is designed to handle basic format specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, and `%%`. The goal is to understand the internal workings of the standard `printf` and implement a simplified version.
